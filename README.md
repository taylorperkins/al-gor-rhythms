Me going through the Algorithm Design Manual Second Edition by Steven S. Skiena. Honing in on algorithm design patterns. 

I want to get better at functional programming concepts and algorithm designs in general. This repository is a way for me to brush up, learn new concepts, practice my ability to read another language (examples in the book are in C), and generally understand the logic flow for creating or implementing some general algorithm design patterns. 

You can purchase the book yourself [here](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202). I would absolutely recommend it, even being a few years old :)
